# BattleOfTheShips

First version of a simple Battle Ships game that allows player to shoot at computer's map.
Solution created in VS2019, written in C#.

A simple game that allows you to shoot at computer's ships by giving target coordinates in the form of "B5". By default map is 10x10 and there are 4 ships placed randomly. The general rule is that there needs to be at least one free field between any two ships (they cannot touch, even on corners).

## Getting Started

The easiest way is to open the solution file in Visual Studio - this allows you to run the application, interact with code and run unit tests.

### Prerequisites

.Net Framework (4.7.4)

### Installing

## Running the tests

Unit tests created from VS2019, can be executed after loading the solution (default shortcut is "Ctrl+R,A")
